# SlackSlash
This is a Firebase project that uses Firebase Functions to define endpoints that can be called by a Slack integration.

## Installation

<!-- When you set up an application in slack, you should be presented with a **Verification Token** under **Basic Information** for your application. This is what should be used for the `VERIFICATION_TOKEN` variable in .env. -->
